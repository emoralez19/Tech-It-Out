        <h4>Description of the Program</h4>
        <p class="text">
            If you like problem-solving, doing puzzles, or thinking logically, consider Computer Science at St. Mary’s University. These degrees include an integrated math minor for our most technical programs.
            Computer science professionals design and develop software to address everyday issues and problems. Computer Science majors at St. Mary’s develop software individually and in a group and are evaluated by industry experts.
            They must be able to communicate effectively in order to talk with technical and non-technical people to assess their needs and then convey back information that is easy to understand.
